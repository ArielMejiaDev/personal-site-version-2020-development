            I worked with Ariel last summer, he was my mentor and advisor for a project I worked on.
            I especially enjoyed brainstorming with Ariel when I needed a creative approach to solve a problem,
            he is always eager to take on new challenges. He is very knowledgable regarding the latest trends in
            technology and could always recommend an article or website to pick up skills relevant to a my project.
            Most of all, he is passionate about what he does and it comes through in his work and in the energy he brings to the office.
